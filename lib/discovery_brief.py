"""Feature 3 — cross-round discovery brief.

A single run of a hard target burns most of its budget on *rediscovery*:
re-reading the same source files and re-issuing the same catalog searches
that a prior attempt already ran. This module mines a finished task's trace
(`claude_raw/round_*.jsonl`) for the files the agent explored/edited and the
searches it issued, and persists a compact per-target brief. The next attempt
on the same target gets that brief injected so it starts from the prior map
instead of re-walking the tree.

Signal-vs-noise is the whole game: a brief that lists *everything* is as
useless as no brief. So the miner separates high-signal from low:
  - **edits** (files actually touched) rank above reads, and an edited file
    is dropped from the reads list so it is never double-listed;
  - **reads** are weighted by revisit count — files the agent kept returning
    to (read 2+×) are likely load-bearing dependencies and are surfaced with
    their counts, while files opened exactly once are compressed onto a single
    "skimmed once" line rather than given a bullet each;
  - **searches** are stripped down to `skill "query"` — the `--project` /
    `--catalog-cache` tails are machine-specific and redundant (the prompt
    already hands the agent the cache path), so they are noise here.

Deterministic, stdlib-only. Keyed by target_id (`target_path.stem`, the same
granularity as failure_memory). One markdown file per target under
`<results_root>/discovery_briefs/<target_id>.md`.
